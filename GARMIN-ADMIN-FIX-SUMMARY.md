# Garmin Admin Fix Summary

## Problem
Activities created in the Garmin admin were not being properly saved and linked to users, and users couldn't see them in their profile.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `/api/admin/workouts/route.ts` GET endpoint which was fetching all workouts without filtering by user ID. The frontend was then filtering the workouts client-side, which was inefficient and could cause issues.

## Solution
1. Modified the GET endpoint in `/api/admin/workouts/route.ts` to accept a `userId` query parameter and filter workouts on the server side.
2. Updated the standalone Garmin admin page (`app/admin/garmin/page.tsx`) to pass the selected user ID to the API endpoint.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoint Update (`app/api/admin/workouts/route.ts`)
- Added support for `userId` query parameter
- Implemented server-side filtering of workouts by user ID
- Maintained backward compatibility (when no userId is provided, all workouts are returned)

### 2. Frontend Update (`app/admin/garmin/page.tsx`)
- Modified the `loadUserActivities` function to pass the selected user ID as a query parameter
- Removed client-side filtering since the API now returns only the relevant workouts

## Testing
Created a test script (`scripts/test-garmin-admin-fix.ts`) to verify that:
1. Workouts can be created for specific users
2. Workouts can be retrieved for specific users
3. The API correctly filters workouts by user ID

## Benefits
- Improved performance by moving filtering to the server side
- Reduced data transfer between server and client
- Fixed the issue where users couldn't see their activities in their profile
- More efficient database queries
